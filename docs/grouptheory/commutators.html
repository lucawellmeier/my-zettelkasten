   Commutators
</h1>




<h1 class="h2" id="h1">
  1. Definitions and basic properties
</h1>





<p>We define the <strong>commutator</strong> of $[x,y] = x^{-1}y^{-1}xy$. We
immediately verify the following properties:</p>





<ul>
<li>$xy = yx[x,y]$</li>
<li>$[y,x] = [x,y]^{-1}$</li>
<li>$[xy,z] = [x,z]^y[y,z]$</li>
<li>$[z,xy] = [z,y][z,x]^y$</li>
</ul>





<p>For two subgroups $H,K$ the <strong>commutator subgroup</strong> is 
$[H,K] = \langle [h,k] \rangle \lhd \langle H, K \rangle$.
In particular, we call $G' = [G,G]$ the <strong>derived subgroup</strong>.</p>






<div  class="statement">
  <u>Theorem 1.1</u>:
  
  <p>If $G = AB$ is the product of abelian subgroups, then $G'$ abelian.</p>

</div>





<div class="proof">
  <p>We only need to prove that two commutators of the form $[a_1, b_1]$
and $[a_2, b_2]$ commute. For this write
\[\begin{aligned}
  a_2[a_1, b_1]a_2^{-1} &= [a_1, b_3] \\
  b_2[a_1, b_1]a_2^{-1} &= [a_4, b_1],
\end{aligned}\]
where $b_1 a_2^{-1} = a_3 b_3$ and $a_1 b_2^{-1} = b_4 a_4$.
Conjugate the first equation by $b_2^{-1}$ and the second by
$a_2^{-1}$.</p>

</div>


<p>By a straightforward computation one sees that a factor group
$G/N$ is abelian if and only if $G' \leq N$, and hence
$G'$ is the unique smallest normal subgroup of $G$ with abelian
factor group. By similar computations one can also verify
the following generalization:</p>






<div id="commutatorsubgroupvanishesinfactor" class="statement">
  <u>Lemma 1.2</u>:
  
  <p>$HN/N$ and $KN/N$ commute element-wise if and only if $[H,K] \leq N$.</p>

<p>In particular, if $K < H$ are both normal then $H/K \leq Z(G/K)$ if 
and only if $[H,G] \leq K$.</p>

</div>


<h1 class="h2" id="h2">
  2. The lower central series and finite p-groups
</h1>





<p>The <strong>lower central series</strong> of a group is recursively defined by
$\gamma_1(G) = G$ and $\gamma_n(G) = [\gamma_{n-1}(G),G]$.
Note that the lower central series is a reversed (and
index-shifted) central series.
As a basic consequence of <a href="#commutatorsubgroupvanishesinfactor">Lemma 1.,. .2</a> one has</p>






<div  class="statement">
  <u>Proposition 2.1</u>:
  
  <p>$G$ nilpotent if and only if $\gamma_n(G) = 1$ for some $n$.</p>

</div>



<p>Like for the upper central series, the lower central series is minimal
in the sense that the nilpotency class of $G$ is the smallest $c$ such
that $\gamma_{c+1}(G) = 1$.</p>





<p>Now if $|G| = p^n$ is a $p$-group we clearly have 
$\operatorname{cl}(G) \leq n$. But we can do better:</p>






<div  class="statement">
  <u>Proposition 2.2</u>:
  
  <p>$|G| = p^n$, then $\operatorname{cl}(G) \leq n - 1$.</p>

</div>





<div class="proof">
  <p>It suffices to prove that if $G/\gamma_2(G) \leq p$ implies
$\gamma_2(G) = 1$. For this, in turn, one only has to notice that
$G/\gamma_3(G)$ is abelian.</p>

</div>


<p>This bound is sharp: Let $H = \langle x \rangle \cong C_p$, 
$K = \langle \sigma \rangle \leq \operatorname{Sym}(p)$ with
$\sigma = (1 \, 2 \, \cdots \, p)$ and $G = H \wr K$. 
For the elements $\xi = (x, 1, \cdots, 1) \in H^p$ and 
$\xi_i = [\xi, \sigma, \cdots, \sigma] \in \gamma_{i+1}(G)$, 
one easily verifies that $\xi_{p-1} \neq 1$ and hence 
$\operatorname{cl}(G) = p$.</p>





<p>In the special case $\operatorname{cl}(G) \leq 2$ we have an important
arithmetic rule:</p>






<div id="arithmetic-rule-cl-2" class="statement">
  <u>Lemma 2.3</u>:
  
  <p>$\operatorname{cl}(G) \leq 2$, then $(a,b)^t = a^t b^t [b,a]^{t \choose 2}$.</p>

</div>





<div class="proof">
  <p>Induction on $t$ and many uses of the basic arithmetic properties.</p>

</div>


<p>With this little theory alone, one can fully classify the groups of order
$p^3$.</p>




<h1 class="h3" id="h2_1">
  2.1. Groups of order $p^3$
</h1>





<p>Let $|G| = p^3$. The case $G$ abelian is easy: 
\[ G \cong C_{p^3}, C_{p^2} \times C_p, C_p \times C_p \times C_p. \]
Otherwise we have $\operatorname{cl}(G) \leq 2$ and $|G'| = p$.</p>





<p>If $p = 2$ we have the two possibilities
\[ G \cong Q_8, D_8. \]</p>





<p>Assume $p \neq 2$.</p>




<h1 class="h4" id="h">
   1. case: $G$ contains an element of order $p^2$
</h1>





<p>Call it $a$. First, we assume by contradiction that $A = \langle a \rangle \lhd G$ 
has no complement in $G$: 
Then all elements $b$ of order $p$ satisfy $b \in \langle a^p \rangle$. Therefore,
an element $b \notin A$ we have $\langle b^p \rangle = \langle a^p \rangle$.
Then by <a href="#arithmetic-rule-cl-2">Lemma 2.,. .3</a> $(a b^{-1})^p = 1$. Contradiction.</p>





<p>Hence there is a complement $\langle b \rangle$ and
$G = A \rtimes \langle b \rangle$ with $|b| = p$. We count all possible
homomorphisms $\langle b \rangle \to \operatorname{Aut}(A)$. 
$\operatorname{Aut}(A)$ is abelian, so its order is $\phi(p^2) = p (p-1)$.
Its Sylow $p$-subgroup (unique!) is generated by the map $a \mapsto a^{p+1}$ and so 
\[ G \cong \langle a,b,c \mid |a|=p^2, |b|=p, a^b = a^{p+1} \rangle. \]</p>




<h1 class="h4" id="h">
   2. case: $G$ has exponent $p$
</h1>





<p>Choose a maximal subgroup $H$: $H = \langle a \rangle \times \langle b \rangle$ 
with $|a| = |b| = p$. Again let $c \notin H$, so $G = H \rtimes \langle c \rangle$,
and count the homomorphisms. Note that 
$\operatorname{Aut}(H) \cong \operatorname{GL}(2,p)$ and that all its elements of 
order $p$ are conjugates of $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$ (by Jordan).
Hence
\[ G \cong \langle a,b,c \mid |a| = |b| = |c| = p, a^c = ab, b^c = b \rangle, \]
which, in fact, has exponent $p$ since $p \neq 2$ and by <a href="#arithmetic-rule-cl-2">Lemma 2.,. .3</a>.</p>





<hr />




<h1 class="h4" id="h">
   General exponent
</h1>





<p>For general exponent $m$ let $g_m(p)$ be the number of groups of order $p^m$.
Computing them is an open problem.
For example, the following values are known:</p>





<ul>
<li>$g_1(p) = 1$</li>
<li>$g_2(p) = 2$</li>
<li>$g_3(p) = 5$</li>
<li>$g_4(p) = \begin{cases} 
      14 \quad &\text{if } p = 2 \\ 
      15 \quad &\text{otherwise} \end{cases}$</li>
<li>$g_5(p) = \begin{cases}
      51 \quad &\text{if } p = 2 \\
      67 \quad &\text{if } p = 3 \\
      2p + 2(p - 1,3) + (p-1, 4) + 61 \quad &\text{otherwise} \end{cases}$</li>
</ul>





<p>It is supposed that these numbers are given by polynomials on residue classes:</p>





<p>CONJECTURE Higman's PORC conjecture</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For fixed $n$ there exists $N$ and polynomials $f_{n,i}$ ($0 \leq i \leq N-1$)
  such that $p \equiv i \mod N$ implies $g_n(p) = f_{n,i}(p)$</p>
</blockquote>




<h1 class="h3" id="h2_2">
  2.2. Burnside's basis theorem and the Frattini subgroup
</h1>





<p>For $p$-groups one can describe the Frattini subgroup precisely. This 
reveals also certain generating properties.</p>






<div id="factor-of-frattini" class="statement">
  <u>Theorem 2.4</u>:
  
  <p>$G$ finite. We have $\operatorname{Frat}(G) = G' G^p$
and $G/\operatorname{Frat(G)} \cong C_p^d$ such that $d = d(G)$ is the smallest 
cardinality of a generating set of $G$.</p>

</div>





<div class="proof">
  <p>"$\geq$": $G/M = C_p$ for a maximal subgroup $M$.</p>

<hr />

<p>"$\cong$" and "$\leq$": $G/G'G^p$ is abelian of exponent $p$, hence isomorphic
to $C_p^d$ and so $\operatorname{Frat}(G/G'G^p) = 1$.</p>

<hr />

<p>"smallest": $d \leq d(G)$ clear. Reverse follows from the uselessness of 
the Frattini subgroup.</p>

</div>


<p>As consequence one gets</p>






<div  class="statement">
  <u>Theorem 2.5</u>:
   <strong>Burnside's basis theorem</strong>
  <p>$G$ finite $p$-group with $|G/\operatorname{Frat}(G)| = p^d$. 
Every set of generators  contains a generating subset of $d$ elements.</p>

</div>





<div class="proof">
  <p>$G/\operatorname{Frat}(G)$ is a $d$-dimensional vector space over $\Z/p\Z$.</p>

</div>


<p>We now prove two important applications as consequences of the previous considerations.</p>





<p>For the first, remember that a finite group with a unique maximal subgroup is
cyclic (another consequences of the uselessness of Frattini's subgroup). 
Now we assume that $G$ has a unique minimal subgroup. By Sylow theorems $G$ must
be a $p$-group.</p>






<div  class="statement">
  <u>Theorem 2.6</u>:
  
  <p>If $p\neq 2$ and $G$ finite with a unique minimal subgroup, then $G$ is cyclic.</p>

</div>





<div class="proof">
  <p>Induction on |G|, so all maximal subgroups of $G$ are cyclic. From this we
can deduce that it suffices to prove the case $d \leq 2$.
Take $\langle a \rangle \neq \langle b \rangle$ max. subgroups s.t. 
$G = \langle a,b\rangle$.
Then 
$\operatorname{Frat}(G) = \langle a \rangle \cap \langle b \rangle \leq Z(G)$,
and so $\operatorname{cl}(G) \leq 2$.</p>

<hr />

<p>W.l.o.g. $\operatorname{Frat}(G) = \langle f \rangle \neq 1$ and $a^p = b^p = f$.
Now if $|f| = p^m$, say, then we must have $|g| = p^{m+1}$ for all $g \notin \langle f \rangle$. 
Hence for $c = ab^{-1}$ one proves that $c^p \in \langle f^p \rangle$, and, consequently,
$c \in \operatorname{Frat}(G)$. It follows $\langle a,b \rangle = \langle a \rangle$.</p>

</div>


<p>And, finally, a bound for the automorphism group of a $p$-group.</p>






<div  class="statement">
  <u>Theorem 2.7</u>:
  
  <p>$|G| = p^n$ with $|G/\operatorname{Frat}(G)| = p^d$. Then
$\operatorname{Aut}(G) \mid p^{(n-d)d} t$ where $t = |\operatorname{GL}(d,p)|$.</p>

</div>





<div class="proof">
  <p>As the Frattini subgroup $F$ is characteristic, the following is a well-defined 
homomorphism
\[ \gamma \colon \operatorname{Aut}(G) \to \operatorname{Aut}(G/F),
    \alpha \mapsto (gF \mapsto g^\alpha F) \]
with kernel $C$. After an application of the homomorphism theorem we see that 
it suffices to prove that $|C|$ divides $p^{(n-d)d}$.</p>

<hr />

<p>Component-wise conjugation defines an action of $C$ on 
$\Omega = \{(g_1 f_1, \cdots, g_d f_d)\}$,
where $G = \langle g_1, \cdots, g_d \rangle$ is a fixed generating set.
Note that the stabilizers are $1$ and conclude.</p>

</div>

<h1 class="h2" id="h3">
  3. The derived series and the three-subgroups lemma
</h1>





<p>We define the <strong>derived series</strong> recursively by $G^{(0)} = G$ and 
$G^{(n)} = (G^{(n-1)})'$. Similar to the lower central series this is
a reversed abelian series:</p>






<div  class="statement">
  <u>Proposition 3.1</u>:
  
  <p>$G$ soluble if and only if $G^{(n)} = 1$ for some $n$.</p>

</div>



<p>It is, moreover, minimal in the sense that the minimal $n$ such that 
$G^{(n)} = 1$ is the derived length of $G$.</p>




<h1 class="h3" id="h3_1">
  3.1. Interlude: Burnside's problem
</h1>





<blockquote>
  <p>Question: Are finitely generated torsion groups finite?</p>
</blockquote>





<p>The answer is clearly positive, if $G$ is abelian.</p>





<p>It is also positive if $G$ is nilpotent: To see this we define the <strong>abelianization</strong> $G_{ab} = \gamma_1(G) / \gamma_2(G)$.
The map
\[\begin{aligned}
  \gamma_i(G)/\gamma_{i+1}(G) \times G_{ab} &\to \gamma_{i+1}(G)/\gamma_{i+2}(G) \\
  (a \gamma_{i+1}(G), g \gamma_2(G)) &\mapsto [a,g] \gamma_{i+2}(G)
\end{aligned}\]
is a well-defined, surjective, bilinear map. Therefore, by tensoring one sees
that $\gamma_{i+1}(G) / \gamma_{i+2}(G)$ is an epimorphic image of
$\gamma_i(G) / \gamma_{i+1}(G) \otimes G_{ab}$. 
Iterating yields an epimorphism $G_{ab} \otimes \cdots \otimes G_{ab} \to \gamma_{i}(G) / \gamma_{i+1}(G)$ of $i$ copies of $G_{ab}$.</p>






<div  class="statement">
  <u>Theorem 3.2</u>:
  
  <p>$\mathcal{P}$ group-theoretical property, inherited by images of tensor products 
and by extensions. 
If $G$ is nilpotent and $G_{ab}$ has $\mathcal{P}$, then $G$ has $\mathcal{P}$.</p>

</div>





<div class="proof">
  <p>Write the lower central series from big to low, traverse from top to bottom
to see that all the quotients have $\mathcal{P}$ and then all the way back
to verify that by iterated extensions also $G$ has $\mathcal{P}$.</p>

</div>


<p>For example, this holds for finite groups, torsion groups, $\pi$-groups and
finitely generated groups.</p>





<p>Therefore, if $G$ is finitely generated and torsion, so is $G_{ab}$ as a 
quotient and hence $G_{ab}$ is finite as it is abelian.
Therefore, $G$ is finite.</p>





<hr />





<p>The answer is also "yes" for soluble groups.</p>






<div id="subgroup-finitely-generated" class="statement">
  <u>Lemma 3.3</u>:
  
  <p>$|G:H| < \infty$, $G$ finitely generated $\implies$ $H$ finitely generated.</p>

</div>





<div class="proof">
  <p>Fix a finite set of generators $X$ of $G$, such that $X = X^{-1}$, and 
a right transversal $T$ of $H$ containing the $1$.
Note that for every $t$ and $x$ there exists a unique $\overline{tx} \in T$ such
that $Htx = H\overline{tx}$ and note that $Y = \{ tx(\overline{tx})^{-1} \}$
is a finite subset of $H$.
Then by induction one can easily prove that any $g = x_1 \cdots x_r$ can be 
rewritten as $g = y_1 \cdots y_r t$.</p>

</div>


<p>So if $G$ is soluble, torsion and finitely generated one can deduce finiteness
by induction on the derived length of $G$, since <a href="#subgroup-finitely-generated">Lemma 3.,. .3</a>
implies that in this case $G/G'$ and $G'$ are finite.</p>





<p>To see that finite-generatedness is needed consider the following example:</p>





<p>Let $G = A \rtimes B$, where $A = C_{2^\infty}$ and $B = \la b \ra = C_2$. 
Note that $G$ is a $2$-group and since $G/A = B$ we have $G' \leq A$.
One deduces that $G' = [A,B] = A$ and hence $G/G'$ is finite but
$G$ is not while $G$ is soluble of derived length $2$.</p>





<hr />





<p>Generally, though, the answer is negative. 
In 1976 Adian and Novikov proved that the <strong>Burnside group</strong> $B(m,n)$ (the 
free group with $m$ generators and exponent $n$) is, in fact, infinite for
$m \geq 2$ and $n \geq 665$.</p>









<p>We know that, if it is, the group has order $5^{34}$.</p>




<h1 class="h3" id="h3_2">
  3.2. The three-subgroups lemma

<p>We use left-association to denote multi-commutators. By direct computation:</p>






<div  class="statement">
  <u>Lemma 3.4</u>:

  <p>\[ [x, y^{-1}, z]^y [y, z^{-1}, x]^z [z, x^{-1}, y]^x = 1 \]</p>

</div>



<p>With this we can establish relations between the lower central series and the
derived series.</p>






<div  class="statement">
  <u>Theorem 3.6</u>:
  
  <ol>

<li>If $G$ is nilpotent with nilpotency class $c$ and derived length $d$, then
\[ d \leq 1 + \log_2 c \]</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>"(3)": derived from $1 = \gamma_{c+1}(G) \leq G^{(d-1)} \leq \gamma_{2^{d-1}}$.</p>

</div>


<p>Finally, we can prove a solubility criterion:</p>






<div  class="statement">
  <u>Theorem 3.7</u>:
  
  <p>Suppose that $A$ acts via automorphism on $G$ and assume $[G,A, \dots, A] = 1$ 
of $m$ copies of $A$.
Then $A^{(m-1)} \leq C_A(G)$.</p>

</div>





<div class="proof">
  <p>Let $H = [G,A]$. By induction on $m$ since $[H, A, \cdots, A]$ with $m-1$ copies
we have $A^{(m-2)} \leq C_A(H)$. Note that $A \supset A^{(m-2)}$ and 
\[ 1 = [H,A^{(m-2)}] = [G,A,A^{(m-2)}] = [G,A^{(m-2)},A^{(m-2)}] = [A^{(m-2)}, G, A^{(m-2)}]. \]
Conclude by applying <a href="#three-subgroups">Proposition 3.,. .5</a></p>

</div>


<p>In particular, if the action is faithful then $C_A(G) = 1$ (since it is the kernel
of the action) and $A$ is soluble of derived length $m-1$.</p>
