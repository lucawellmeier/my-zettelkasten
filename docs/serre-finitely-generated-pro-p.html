   Serre's Theorem on finitely generated pro-$p$ groups
</h1>






<div  class="statement">
  <u>Theorem 0.1</u>:
   <strong>Serre (1965)</strong>
  <p>Let $G$ be a finitely generated pro-$p$ group. Then any abstract subgroup 
of finite index is open.</p>

</div>



<p>It suffices to prove the statement for normal subgroups $N$ of finite index as 
their is always the normal core and so any finite-index subgroup is a union
of (finitely many) open cosets.
We prove by induction on $|G/N|$.
First assume that $G/N$ is not simple.
By quotient correspondence there exists a subgroup $N < K < G$ of smaller index, 
which is open in $G$ by induction.</p>






<div  class="statement">
  <u>Lemma 0.2</u>:
  
  <p>Open subgroups of finitely generated profinite groups are finitely generated.</p>

</div>



<p><strong>Remark</strong>: Finitely generated in the profinite sense does not imply the 
original one.</p>







<div class="proof">
  <p>$X$ a finite generating set of a dense subgroup of $G$. Assume $H$ has finite
index $n$ (open subgroup!). By taking closures, We have
\[ m = [ \la X \ra : \la X \ra \cap H ] \leq [G:H] = n, \]
and so $\la X \ra \cap H = \la Y \ra$ with a finite generating set 
$Y \subset \la X \ra \cap H$. Let $K = \overline{\la Y \ra}$.
Since $K \leq H$ we have $[G:K] \geq n$. Now we prove the other inequality:
choose a right transversal $t_1, \dots t_m$ of $\la Y \ra$ in $\la X \ra$.
We have $G = \bigcup_i K t_i$ which implies $[G:K] \leq m \leq n$.
Hence (since $K \leq H$) $H = K = \la Y \ra$.</p>

</div>


<p>Therefore, $K$ is a finitely generated pro-$p$ group and by induction $N$ is also
open in $K$ since $[G:K] < [G:N]$. This proves the non-simple case.</p>





<p>Now assume $G/N$ is simple.</p>






<div  class="statement">
  <u>Lemma 0.3</u>:
  
  <p>Every subgroup of finite index in a 1-generated profinite group is open.</p>

</div>





<div class="proof">
  <p>Let $g$ be the generator. By considering the unique extension of the map 
$\Z \to G, z \mapsto g^z$ 
to a continuous map on $\hat{\Z}$ one sees that $G$ is an epimorphic image
of $\hat{\Z}$.
Hence there is an $N \lhd_c \hat Z$ such that $G = \hat Z / N$. Take a 
subgroup $H = K/N$ of index $n$. As $\hat \Z / K$ is abelian, 
$n \hat Z \subset K$. But $[\hat Z : n \hat Z] = n$, so $K = n \hat Z$.</p>

</div>



<div  class="statement">
  <u>Lemma 0.4</u>:
  
  <p>If $H$ has index $n$ in the profinite group $G$, then $n \mid |G|$.</p>

</div>



<p><strong>Remark:</strong> Note that the profinite Lagrange theorem only holds for closed 
subgroups so additional work is necessary.</p>







<div class="proof">
  <p>Wlog assume $H$ is normal (otherwise pass to the normal core $H_G \leq H$ 
which has index $\leq n!$ in $G$).
First we take a prime $p | n = [G:H]$. Take an element $gH$ of order $p$ and
let $K = \overline{\la g \ra}$. As $KH / H \cong K/H \cap K$ we see that the
former is finite. Note that $g^p$ is in $H$ and so $g$ has order $p$ in 
$K \cap H$.
$K$ is 1-generated so by the previous lemma $H \cap K$ is open, hence closed,
in $K$ and hence in $G$. Now we may use Lagrange:
\[ p \mid [K:H \cap K] \mid [G:K] [K:H \cap K] [H \cap K:1] = |G|. \]</p>

<hr />

<p>Now let $p^\alpha$ be the largest $p$-power that divides $n$ and $p^\beta$ the
largest that divides $|G|$. We want to prove that $\alpha \leq \beta$ 
(wlog assume that $\beta < \infty$).
Choose an open subgroup $U$ such that $p^\beta$ divides $G/U$ but 
$p^{\beta + 1}$ doesn't and $(|U|,p) = 1$. Note that $U \cap H$ has finite
index in $G$, since $U$ and $H$ have. 
$p$ does not divide $|U|$, so by the first part it is not dividing 
$[U : U \cap H]$.
Therefore, $p^{\beta + 1}$ does not divide $[G:H \cap U]$, but $p^\alpha$ does.</p>

</div>


<p>In our case: A number that doesn't divide $|G| = p^n$ ($n$ possibly infinite) cannot 
be a subgroup index.
Consequently, $G/N$ is a finite $p$ group and simple, so $|G/N| = p$.
But then $G' G^p \leq N$ and we conclude with the following lemmas:</p>






<div  class="statement">
  <u>Lemma 0.5</u>:
  
  <p>$G = \la x_1, \dots, x_d \ra$ a finite $p$-group. Then every element $g \in G'$ 
can be written as $g = [x_1, g_1] \cdots [x_d, g_d]$ for suitable $g_i$.</p>

</div>





<div class="proof">
  <p>By induction on $|G|$. Write $Z = Z(G)$ and assume it not to be the full group.
$uZ \neq 1$ in $Z(G/Z)$. For some $i$ we then have $[x_i, u] \neq 1$.
But also $[x_i, u] \in Z$, so $[x_i, u^r] = [x_i, u]^r$.
Then let $K = \la [x_i, u] \ra$, a non-trivial normal subgroup of $G$.
By induction $gK = [x_1, h_1] \cdots [x_d, h_d] K$ for all $g \in (G/K)'$.
Therefore, $g = [x_1, h_1] \cdots [x_d, h_d] [x_i, u]^r$. 
Again using the fact that $[x_i, u] \in Z$ we can move the last factor in 
the product and replace the $i$-th one by $[x_i, u^r h_i]$.</p>

</div>



<div  class="statement">
  <u>Lemma 0.6</u>:
  
  <p>The subgroup $G' G^p$ in a finitely generated pro-$p$ group is open.</p>

</div>





<div class="proof">
  <p>We first prove that $G'$ is closed. 
Let $G = \overline{\la x_1, \dots, x_d \ra}$ and 
$S = \{ [x_1, g_1] \cdots [x_d, g_d] \mid g_i \in G \}$.
Then $S$ is the image of the continuous map 
$G^d \to G, (g_1, \dots, g_d) \mapsto [x_1, g_1] \cdots [x_d, g_d]$
hence closed.
Let $\mathcal{N}$ be the set of open normal subgroups (all have finite index)
and $N \in \mathcal{N}$. Then $SN/N$ finite and by the previous lemma we have
$SN/N = (G/N)' = G'N/N$, hence $SN = G'N$. Then
\[ S = \overline{S} = \bigcap_{N \in \mathcal{N}} SN 
  = \bigcap_{N \in \mathcal{N}} G'N = \overline{G'}. \]
But $S \subset G'$ so $\overline{G}' = G'$.</p>

<hr />

<p>We know now, that $G/G'$ is profinite, hence compact. Therefore, the image 
$\gamma(G/G') = G' G^p / G'$ of
the continuous map
\[ G/G' \to G/G', g G' \mapsto g^p G' \]
is closed.
Let $x_1, \dots, x_d$ be the generators of a dense subgroup of $G$. Then the
projections $y_1, \dots, y_d$ to $G' G^p$ generate a dense subgroup in the 
quotient.
The subgroup $\la y_1, \dots, y_d \ra$ is abelian and has exponent $p$ and so
it must be finite, hence closed in $G/G' G^p$. 
So $\la y_1, \dots, y_d \ra = G/G' G^p$, i.e. $G' G^p$ is closed of finite index
in $G$, which in turn means that it is open.</p>
